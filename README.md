> In main_feature_extraction.m, Multiscale Dispersion Entorpy(MDE), Multiscale Cumulative Residual Dispersion Entropy(MCRDE), and Multiscale Sample Entropy(MSE)  quantified the complexity of RR intervals for CHF, AF, and Healthy group. Here, a statistical approach is attempted to analyze whether a significant difference exists between the three groups with this quantified entropy values
